      <description>I used to mention creating a purely R-based static website generator named Haiku with my then classmate Arjun about two years ago. I remember that he said the name was nice.
Time flies, and apparently, I did not have the chance to build it. Fortunately, Yihui saved the world again, and now blogdown has become the most elegant and powerful static website generator for R users, especially if you love R Markdown.</description>
