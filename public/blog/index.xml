      <description>Social issues in rural India Inequalities are omnipresent within Indian rural communities. They are perpetuated by the system of castes, which leads to a social stratification of Indiaâ€™s population. Moreover, vulnerability to external stresses is also driven by gender discrimination, which follows on from the systemic marginalisation of women and the differences of power relationships that exist between men and women, especially in India. In order to get an overview of communities, social scientists have to face the challenge of getting access to the views of such marginalised groups.</description>
