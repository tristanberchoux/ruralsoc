<p>OK. There I said it. Everybody should consider #DeletePython.</p>
<p>Recently, people have raised significant concerns regarding Facebook’s privacy
protection practice on their user’s data, with the discussions
on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/brianacton/status/976231995846963201">#DeleteFacebook</a>.
This inspired me to say something about another spicy topic:
<a href="https://twitter.com/road2stat/status/976852015757381632">#DeletePython</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I have to admit that “everyone” might be a bit exaggerating.
The accurate central message would be, everyone who wants to do
some decent, sustainable, modern statistics, should consider R,
but not Python, as the primary language.</p>
<p>I know this may offend some Python lovers, but I do have my reasons,
explained below.</p>
<div id="some-context" class="section level2">
<h2>Some context</h2>
<p>For almost ten years, I have been doing almost everything
that involves programming without major bottlenecks in R.
What I have done includes frequentist/Bayesian statistics,
(statistical) machine learning, recommender systems, bioinformatics,
cheminformatics, data visualization, creating RESTful API, and
building web applications. That gives you an idea that there are
few limits on what you can achieve with R.</p>
<p>As the challenger, I believe Python is a solid general purpose
programming language that could also help people do these things well.
Notably, for “data science” related tasks, many people from computer
science backgrounds probably see Python as a nice, free replacement for
the good old MATLAB (may it rest in peace) for doing machine learning.
People came from pure software engineering backgrounds might also want
to try some statistical modeling in such a language that they are already
familiar.</p>
<p>However, all things being equal, I have to point out that Python also
has seemingly <em>trivial but obvious</em> issues that indeed blocks me to
make myself a contributor to its ecosystem, or even consider it
as a serious language, at least for the “data science” purposes.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-tale-of-two-versions" class="section level2">
<h2>1. A tale of two versions</h2>
<p>Every time I think about using specific code written in Python,
instead of performance considerations, the first question popped
into my head would be: which Python version should I use, 2 or 3?
As is known to most people, Python has this ridiculous issue of
two parallel versions/ecosystems with significant incompatibility
for a relatively long time.</p>
<p>In some Linux distributions, <code>python</code> means Python 3, <code>python2</code>
means Python 2; while in other distributions, <code>python</code> means Python 2,
you need <code>python3</code> to call Python 3. Sometimes, it is even more complex,
for example, if you use <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python">Homebrew Python</a>,
you will be essentially dealing with <code>python</code>, <code>python2</code>, and <code>python3</code>,
along with <code>pip</code>, <code>pip2</code>, <code>pip3</code>.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been genuine improvements
following the progress made by the better adoption of Python 3,
while this could still be a pain point for using the legacy code
written in 2 together with the more recent modules written in 3.
While in R, there is one and only one latest stable version,
and we would always recommend installing this version.</p>
</div>
<div id="scattered-package-management" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Scattered package management</h2>
<p>One side effect of the two interpreter versions is the chaotic
version/package/environment management. Tools like <code>pyenv</code>, <code>virtualenv</code>,
or <code>conda</code> were created to alleviate such issues. However, I think they
made things worse for me eventually. Most of the time we only need
a latest, working interpreter with the latest packages to run the code,
it is that simple — we do not want to learn someone else’s
configurations or fire up some completely different package
manager just for reusing other people’s code.</p>
<p>The version incompatibility and package management issues would almost
surely create technical, even political problems within large organizations.
As many statistical procedures were designed to minimize unnecessary
communications and reduce the error-prone human factors, such issues
should be considered harmful for statistical practice.</p>
</div>
<div id="shallow-copy-for-mutable-objects" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Shallow copy for mutable objects</h2>
<p>One of the most common operations when you code with data,
is copying one object to a new object, then modify the new object.
To do this in R, we merely need to do <code>b = a</code>. When we modify <code>b</code>,
<code>a</code> will not be affected. Life is beautiful.</p>
<p>In contrast, Python decided to perform
<a href="https://perma.cc/YWU8-5EEZ">shallow copy</a>
for its mutable objects. Every time, you will need to remember to use
special ways to achieve such a copy operation, for example, <code>b = a[:]</code> or
<code>b = copy.deepcopy(a)</code>. If not done correctly, you could end up with
some unexpected bugs in your code. Believe me, when we say <strong>copy</strong>
something, we mean to <strong>copy</strong> it, and surely do not want the
modifications for the new object to affect the original one,
especially if you do this every day.</p>
<p>On a relevant note, as a functional programming language,
R’s built-in copy-on-modify semantics made it much, much safer
to modify values, and improves the maintainability of the code.
As long as you are not too careless or not using vectorized code at all,
there will not be significant performance issues.
In case you want to optimize, you will be rewarded for delicate
mathematical and vectorized thinking, which is pretty cool.
Eventually, such functional designs save human time —
the more significant bottleneck in the long run.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-native-data-structures-for-statistical-thinking" class="section level2">
<h2>4. No native data structures for statistical thinking</h2>
<p>Python does not have built-in data structures suitable for
doing statistics. You will almost surely need to use third-party
data structures such as NumPy array or pandas “DataFrame”.
Despite their interoperability and performance issues,
if you used them, you would need the other people to use
the same libraries (sometimes the same versions…)
to reuse and understand your code. It is not
something particularly convenient.</p>
<p>In contrast, I have trusted the vanilla data frame in R
and all the robust <code>base</code> functions for a long time,
not to mention the powerful tidyverse extensions (dplyr, pipes).
In fact, the abstraction of <code>vector</code>, <code>matrix</code>, <code>data frame</code>, and <code>list</code>
is brilliant. These data structures are designed and forged in a way that
they eventually became a natural part of the solution when people think
and solve statistical problems, without thinking much about how exactly
they need to store the data or compute on the data.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I also love the vector-oriented design and thinking in R.
<a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html">Everything is a vector</a>:
factors are special vectors; matrices and arrays are vectors with
dimension attributes; lists are recursive vectors, data frames
are special lists, thus special vectors. After a while, you
will realize that treating vector as the atomic data structure
and building everything on it, fits the paradigm of statistical
thinking perfectly.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-decent-ides-ever." class="section level2">
<h2>5. No decent IDEs, ever.</h2>
<p>I have personally tried almost every mainstream Python IDEs, or editors
with extensions. The conclusion is sad: none of them are good enough.
Maybe my bar is too high, but they all seem to have some common issues,
such as lacking essential features for working with data
(think an object inspector). The most critical problem is, most of them
simply have bad tastes and need better aesthetics in design.</p>
<p>For R, I do not think there is much need to explain:
RStudio is perfect in almost all aspects. It is good even if
you compare it with the many IDEs for many other languages.
Even before RStudio, we had <a href="https://rkward.kde.org/">RKward</a>,
a full-featured beautiful R IDE from the KDE project.</p>
</div>
<div id="closing-remarks" class="section level2">
<h2>Closing remarks</h2>
<p>Thanks to a lot of people’s continuous efforts on improving interoperability,
we could now work with R without having to work with Python directly,
when it is needed to use some Python code/packages. For example,
the recent R package <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/">reticulate</a>
allows you to wrap and use Python modules (such as
<a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/">TensorFlow</a> and
<a href="https://keras.rstudio.com/">Keras</a>) in R,
and evaluate Python code in R Markdown documents seamlessly.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that the tool you choose will, in turn,
influence the way you think. As Prof. Norman Matloff
<a href="https://matloff.wordpress.com/2014/05/21/r-beats-python-r-beats-julia-anyone-else-wanna-challenge-r/">mentioned</a>,
<em>R is written by statisticians, for statisticians.</em>
One example for this is the formula interface [1],
and such stylish designs are often deeply embedded in R.
If you do not have access to such things, you will probably
lose the chance to think or do statistics in a more elegant way.
Thus my point: if you want to do decent, sustainable, and modern
statistics, you might want to start with R, but not Python.</p>
