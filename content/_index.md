This module will take a critical approach to issues of rural development and sustainable resource management at multiple scales, ranging from the global to the local. Through reference to diverse case studies and geographical contexts the module will explore links between development theory, policy and practice and their implications for the environment. Through this study and associated practical elements, students will become effective communicators of geographical ideas. Students are introduced to the importance of communicating appropriately for multiple audiences, using data where appropriate, and explore a range of textual, oral and visual methods to communicate, including weblogs and short ‘pitch’ presentations for policy audiences.
