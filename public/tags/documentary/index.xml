      <description>The world is a fast-changing place. Eleven years ago, when iPhone was first launched, people probably didn’t anticipate that was the end of Nokia. Today, I don’t even use the voice calling feature on my phone anymore, unless really necessary. This might not be good news for AT&amp;amp;T, and maybe I’m an outlier, but this is the truth, this is the world we live.
After walking a long road in such a changing world, it is easy to forget why we started at first.</description>
